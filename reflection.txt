Branches are helpful for collaboration since they let programmers on separate devices work on the same project without interfering with each otherâ€™s code. Since branches are separate workspaces of the same project, different programmers can work on implementing different features and fixing different bugs without directly changing the main codebase. This prevents problems such as conflicting code, disorganization, and bugs within the main program.
